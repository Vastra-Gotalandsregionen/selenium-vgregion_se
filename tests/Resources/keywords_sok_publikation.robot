Test Search Letter Index

    Wait Until Page Contains Element        css:.pagelistblock__charachter  # Sic! Will break if typo is fixed

    Log                                     ${Fragment} # It seems this isn't a fragment but the whole URL + fragment. But it still works so :shrug:
    Click Element                           ${IndexLetterElement}
    Location Should Contain                 ${Fragment}
